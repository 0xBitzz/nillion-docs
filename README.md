# Nillion docs

The Nillion docs are built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. Documentation content lives in the docs folder of this repo, and new sections can be added to the sidebar by including the pages in sidebar.js. Got a suggestion for improving the docs?

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
