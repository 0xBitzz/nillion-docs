Start building on Nillion. The quickstart walks you through

1. Installing the [Nillion SDK](/nillion-sdk-and-tools)
2. Setting up a developer environment
3. Running and connecting to [nillion-devnet](/nillion-devnet), a local Nillion network
4. Writing your first [Nada](/nada-lang) program, `tiny_secret_addition.py`
5. Connecting to the network with the [NillionClient](nillion-client) to store programs, store secrets, and compute on programs with stored secrets.
