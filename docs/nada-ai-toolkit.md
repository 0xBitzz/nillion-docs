# Nada Artificial Intelligence Toolkit

## Overview

The Nillion Network leverages Nada, our MPC language, for defining MPC programs. On top of Nada, we developped a set of libraries for AI programmers to feel at ease when developping with Artificial Intelligence models on top of Nillion. These libraries are built on top of Nada DSL and are meant to be intercompatible with it.
