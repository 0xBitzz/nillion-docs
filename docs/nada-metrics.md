# Nada Metrics

#### Count of Communication Rounds
Number of times that a specific instance of protocol exchanged data during its execution.

#### Compute Duration

The effective time was taken to execute the program's protocols by a node.

#### Calls

Number of times that a protocol's variant was called during the program execution.

#### Duration

The effective time that a node spent to execute a specific instance of a protocol.

#### Execution Duration

The time was taken to complete a program execution.

#### Execution Step

The step in the Execution Plan in which a protocol was executed.

#### Local Protocols

The number of local protocol executed.

#### Number of Communication rounds
Number of times that a specific protocol's instance exchanged data during its execution.

#### Online Protocols

The number of online protocols executed.

#### Preprocessing elements

Number of preprocessing element used by the protocols during the execution.

#### Round message size

The amount of data exchanged during a specific communication round.

#### Total Network Size

The amount of data exchanged during a protocol's instance execution.

#### Total Network Message Size

The amount of data exchanged during the program execution.

#### Total Rounds

The number of times that the nodes have exchanged data between them during the program execution.

#### Used preprocessing elements

The amount of preprocessing elements that a protocol was used by during its execution. It also reports the amount of each type of preprocessing element that was needed.
