# Create a Nada project and write your first Nada program

The <strong>[`nada`](/nada)</strong> tool is used to create a new Nada project, compile all programs in the project, run Nada programs, and generate tests for Nada programs.

## Create a new Nada project

Create a `quickstart` directory. Inside of `quickstart`, use the <strong>[`nada`](/nada)</strong> tool to create a new nada project named "nada_quickstart_programs" by running

```
mkdir quickstart
cd quickstart
nada init nada_quickstart_programs
```

## Set up a Python virtual environment and install nada-dsl

The Nillion Network leverages Nada, our MPC language, for defining MPC programs. Our initial implementation of Nada comes in the form of Nada, a Python DSL (Domain Specific Language).

:::info

You'll need [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.11 or higher with a working [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) installed to import the nada_dsl dependency. Before setting up your Python virtual environment, confirm that you have python3 (version >=3.11) and pip installed

```
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
```

0. Change directories into your new nada project directory

   ```
   cd nada_quickstart_programs
   ```

<VenvSetup/>

## Write your first Nada program

Open the `nada_quickstart_programs` folder in your code editor of choice.

:::info

Your Nada project has the following structure:

```
nada-project.toml  # Configuration file for your Nada programs
src/               # Directory for writing Nada programs
src/main.py        # An example Nada program that adds 2 secret integers
target/            # Directory where `nada build` puts resulting compiled programs
tests/             # Directory where `nada generate-test` puts resulting test files
```

:::

### 1. Create a Nada program file

The `src/` directory is where you'll write your Nada programs. Create a new Nada program file in the src directory. The `secret_addition.py` Nada program will add 2 SecretInteger Nada values together.

```
touch src/secret_addition.py
```

### 2. Write the secret addition Nada program

Copy this Nada program into the `secret_addition.py` file. Don't worry, we'll go through a line by line explanation of the program next.

```python
from nada_dsl import *

def nada_main():

    party1 = Party(name="Party1")

    my_int1 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int1", party=party1))

    my_int2 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int2", party=party1))

    new_int = my_int1 + my_int2

    return [Output(new_int, "my_output", party1)]
```

### 3. Understand each line of the `secret_addition.py` Nada program

<UnderstandingProgram/>

## Compile, run, and test your Nada program

<CompileRunTest/>

## Next steps

ðŸ§® Fantastic work! You just created your first Nada project and wrote and tested a Nada program. Now you can move onto the final step: hooking up the `secret_addition` Nada program to a blind app, which will be able to store the program, then compute with the program on secret, user provided inputs.
