# Developer Quickstart

Welcome to Nillion's developer quickstarts. Get started with our Python or JavaScript clients - after finishing each one, you will have:
1. Installed the [Nillion SDK](http://docs.nillion.com/nillion-sdk-and-tools)
2. Set up your developer environment
3. Written your first nada program
4. Run the program against the local nillion devnet with your chosen client

# Choose your path: Python or JavaScript

The Python Quickstart uses [nillion-python-starter](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nillion-python-starter) to connect to your local Nillion network with the Nillion [Python Client](/python-client). This quickstart is ideal for developers interested in connecting backends to Nillion.

The JavaScript Quickstart uses [scaffold-nillion](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/scaffold-nillion), a NextJS starter repo, to connect to your local Nillion network with the Nillion [JavaScript Client](/js-client). This quickstart is ideal for developers interested in creating frontends or web apps on Nillion.
