# Hacker house - initial Nillion task - Windows

ðŸ‘‹Â Hey, welcome to [Nillion](https://docs.nillion.com/). We are really pleased to have you start your journey with us.

This page describes the initial Nillion task for Hacker House Goa for Windows users. If you are on MacOS or Linux, head over to [this page](https://docs.nillion.com/hacker-house).

Note; Nillion will only work with WSL on Windows, please ensure you are using this while you go through the initial task below. Any questions about getting set up with WSL, please contact the hackathon organisers :).

The initial task should take 30-45 minutes and will help you get started with Nillion. Join our social channels, and start working with our SDK. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them on the discord channel.

The 50 best tasks that are submitted will be awarded a $20 prize ðŸŽ‰ Good luck!
