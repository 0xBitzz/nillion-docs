# Nillion Network

## Dual Network Architecture

The Nillion Network has a Dual Network Architecture: **the Coordination Layer and the Petnet.**

[NilChain](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nilchain) is the Coordination Layer for the Nillion Network. It coordinates payments for blind computations and storage operations performed on the network.

The Petnet harnesses privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) including [Nillion's MPC Protocol](/nillions-mpc-protocol) to secure distributed secrets and perform blind computation. It operates without a global shared state or consensus on order, focusing instead on decentralizing trust for high value data across the network using clusters of nodes.

## Testnet

### Nillion Testnet (Coordination Layer)

The Nillion Testnet is live! Follow our [Testnet Guides](/testnet-guides) to create a wallet connected to the Nillion Testnet, use the Nillion Testnet Faucet, and send Testnet NIL tokens.

### ðŸ”œ Petnet Testnet

The Petnet Testnet is in private beta. Today builders can use the [Nillion SDK](/nillion-sdk-and-tools) to connect their blind applications to a local [nillion-devnet](/nillion-devnet). Upon Petnet Testnet integration with the Coordination Layer in [Phase 2 of Nillion Network deployment](https://nillion.com/news/589/), builders will be able to connect their blind applications to the Nillion Network Testnet, making them accessible to the whole community.
