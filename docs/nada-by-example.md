# Nada by Example

Welcome to **Nada by Example**, an introduction to the Nada language with reference examples from the [nada-by-example](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nada-by-example) repo. [Nada DSL](https://pypi.org/project/nada-dsl) is a Python-based language for defining MPC (Multi-Party Compute) programs on the [Nillion Network](/network). 

Developers can use Nada to write programs that handle secret inputs from multiple parties (i.e., multiple users). These programs compute in a way that ensures they are “blind” to the underlying data, meaning they cannot access or view the secret inputs. This concept is known as “blind computation.”

To learn more about Nada, check out the full [Nada language docs here](/nada-lang).
