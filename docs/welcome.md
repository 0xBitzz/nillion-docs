# Welcome to Nillion's Docs (V2)

Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high value data in the same way that blockchains decentralized transactions.

**What if privacy was an enabler of use cases rather than a constraint?**

Developers can use Nillion to build secure, [high value data](about/high-value-data.md) focused applications. Nillion empowers developers to

- write programs in PyNada, our language for defining MPC programs
- compile programs with the PyNada compiler
- upload programs to the Nillion Network
- store permissioned secrets (high value data) on the Nillion Network
- run programs to compute on secrets on the Nillion Network

### Nillion Network access

The Nillion Network is in private beta for now. Builders can [fill out this DeForm](https://app.deform.cc/form/51a162ff-4ffb-4d9b-86ec-249f087a332f/) to apply for Nillion Network access through our [Nucleus Builders Program](nucleus-builders-program.md).
