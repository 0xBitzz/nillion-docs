# Running a node

## Node Deployment Kit (NDK)

The Nillion Node Deployment Kit (NDK) is a tool used to deploy a node on the Nillion Network. Internally we also use the NDK with additional automation to provision multi-node networks such as the devnet, testnet and in time, the future mainnet.

## Permissioned Nodes

Today Nillion Network nodes are permissioned. We plan to open source the NDK and allow anyone to participate as a node operator permissionlessly in the future.
