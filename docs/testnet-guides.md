# Testnet Guides

Nillion has a [four-phase strategy](https://nillion.com/news/589/) for deploying the [Nillion Network](/network).

During [Phase 1: Genesis Sprint](https://nillion.com/news/589/), it became possible to interact with the [NilChain testnet](/network#nilchain-testnet) (also known as the [Coordination Layer](/network#dual-network-architecture)) using NIL testnet tokens. Follow the guides below to create a wallet connected to the NilChain testnet, to use the Testnet Faucet, and to send NIL tokens on the NilChain testnet.

We are now in [Phase 2: From Genesis to Convergence](https://nillion.com/news/817/), which means it is possible to interact with the [Petnet testnet](/network#petnet-testnet) (also known as the [Orchestration Layer](/network#dual-network-architecture)) by storing data and performing blind computations over that data.
