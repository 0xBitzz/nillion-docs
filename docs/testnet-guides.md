# Testnet Guides

Nillion has a [four-phase strategy](https://nillion.com/news/589/) for deploying the [Nillion Network](/network). We're currently in [Phase 1, the Genesis Sprint](https://nillion.com/news/589/). During Phase 1, you can interact with the Nillion Testnet, aka the [Coordination Layer](/network#nillion-testnet-coordination-layer), using Testnet NIL tokens. 

Follow our Testnet Guides to create a wallet connected to the Nillion Testnet, use the Nillion Testnet Faucet, and send Testnet NIL tokens.
