Open the file and import nada_dsl

```python
from nada_dsl import *
```

Create a function called nada_main() that will contain the code you want to run

```python
from nada_dsl import *
def nada_main():
```

### Add a party

In Nada you have to declare the parties involved in the computation through the `Party` type. A `Party` is defined with a name.

:::info

Here's an example of a `Party`

```python
Party(name="Steph")
```

:::

Create party1, a `Party` named "Party1"

```python
from nada_dsl import *
def nada_main():

    party1 = Party(name="Party1")
```

### Learn about inputs

Nada programs have inputs. An `Input` is defined with a name and a party, which is the `Party` providing the input.

:::info
Here's an example of an `Input`:

```python
Input(name="numberOfDogs", party=Party(name="Steph"))
```

:::

Nada program inputs are typed. There are a few categories of types

Secrecy level

- Literal: literal values provided in the program
- Public: visible to all nodes
- Secret: secret values to be handled by the computing nodes as shares or particles

Scalar

- Boolean
- Integer
- Rational
- String

These categories are combined into types like `SecretInteger`, which are used to type an Input. [See all types](/nada-lang-types)

:::info
Here's an example of a `SecretInteger` Input provided by Steph

```python
steph = Party(name="Steph")
stephs_secret_int = SecretInteger(Input(name="numberOfDogs", party=steph))
```

:::

### Create 2 secret integers inputs

- `my_int1`, a `SecretInteger` named "my_int1" owned by Party1
- `my_int2`, a `SecretInteger` named "my_int2" owned by Party1

```python
from nada_dsl import *

def nada_main():
    party1 = Party(name="Party1")
    my_int1 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int1", party=party1))
    my_int2 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int2", party=party1))
```

Add the integers by creating a new variable called new_int and setting it equal to my_int1 + my_int2

```python
from nada_dsl import *

def nada_main():
    party1 = Party(name="Party1")
    my_int1 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int1", party=party1))
    my_int2 = SecretInteger(Input(name="my_int2", party=party1))

    new_int = my_int1 + my_int2
```

Finally, Nada programs return an output. The `Output` type is used to declare a named output that will be revealed to a concrete `Party`. The Output has a name and a party as parameters.

### Return the output

Nada programs return an array of outputs.

:::info
Here's an example of an output. The output is named `total_score`, its value is `score_int`, and it can be read by the party named Steph.

```python
Output(score_int, "total_score", Party(name="Steph"))
```

:::

Complete your Nada program by adding a final line that returns an array with one output. The output is named "my_output", its value is `new_int`, and it can be ready by `party1`.
